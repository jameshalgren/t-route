    "\n",
    "    1. Routing model application occurs at the reach scale. \n",
    "    \n",

    "    - **Segment** - the elementary building blocks of a stream network defined as a linear strech of river with a certain length and uniform geomorphic parameters (e.g. width, slope, roughness, etc). Segments are the nodes in generic network lingo. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Reach** - A linear combination of segments between two junction points, between a headwater and a junction, or between a junction and a tailwater. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Subnetwork** - A series of connected segments (and reaches) that drain to the same tailwater. The Mississippi River Basin is a subnetwork of the greater CONUS river network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Supernetwork** - A large assembly of stream segments, often composing many different subnetworks.\n",
    "    \n",
